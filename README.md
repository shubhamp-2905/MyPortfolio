> "I build reliable systems powered by AI."

Computer Science student focused on backend systems, machine learning pipelines and real-world problem solving. I care about correctness, scalability and long-term maintainability.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- **Problem First**: Understanding the 'why' before the 'how'.
- **System Design**: Simple systems scale better than complex ones.
- **Reliability**: Correctness is not optional.
- **Code as Communication**: Write clean, self-documenting code.
- **Performance**: Efficiency matters, every millisecond counts.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Software is living; improve with every commit.
